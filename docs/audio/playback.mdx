## Basic Playback

After loading a sound, you can play it using the `play()` method:

```dart
final handle = await SoLoud.instance.play(
  sound,
  volume: 1.0,
  pan: 0.0,
  paused: false,
  looping: false,
);
```

The returned `handle` uniquely identifies this instance of the playing sound.

## Playback Controls

### Pausing and Resuming

```dart
// Toggle pause state
SoLoud.instance.pauseSwitch(handle);

// Set specific pause state
SoLoud.instance.setPause(handle, true); // pause
SoLoud.instance.setPause(handle, false); // resume

// Check pause state
final isPaused = SoLoud.instance.getPause(handle);
```

### Stopping Playback

```dart
await SoLoud.instance.stop(handle);
```

### Seeking

```dart
// Seek to specific position
SoLoud.instance.seek(handle, Duration(seconds: 5));

// Get current position
final position = SoLoud.instance.getPosition(handle);
```

## Looping

Enable looping during playback:

```dart
final handle = await SoLoud.instance.play(
  sound,
  looping: true,
  loopingStartAt: Duration(seconds: 1),
);
```

Control looping for an already playing sound:

```dart
// Enable/disable looping
SoLoud.instance.setLooping(handle, true);

// Set loop point
SoLoud.instance.setLoopPoint(handle, Duration(seconds: 1));

// Check if looping
final isLooping = SoLoud.instance.getLooping(handle);
```

## Playback Speed

Adjust the playback speed of a sound:

```dart
// Set relative play speed (1.0 is normal speed)
SoLoud.instance.setRelativePlaySpeed(handle, 2.0); // Play twice as fast

// Get current play speed
final speed = SoLoud.instance.getRelativePlaySpeed(handle);
```

## Voice Protection

Protect important sounds from being stopped when voice limit is reached:

```dart
// Protect background music from being stopped
SoLoud.instance.setProtectVoice(musicHandle, true);
```

## Voice Management

```dart
// Set maximum number of concurrent sounds (default is 16)
SoLoud.instance.setMaxActiveVoiceCount(32);

// Get current number of playing sounds
final activeVoices = SoLoud.instance.getActiveVoiceCount();

// Check if a handle is still valid
final isValid = SoLoud.instance.getIsValidVoiceHandle(handle);
```

## Best Practices

- Always keep track of sound handles for sounds you need to control
- Dispose sounds when they're no longer needed
- Use voice protection for important sounds like background music
- Consider setting appropriate voice limits based on your app's needs
