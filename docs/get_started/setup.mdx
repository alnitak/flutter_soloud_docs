## Platform Setup

### Web Platform
To use this plugin on the web platform, add the following scripts to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="assets/packages/flutter_soloud/web/libflutter_soloud_plugin.js" defer></script>
<script src="assets/packages/flutter_soloud/web/init_module.dart.js" defer></script>
```

See the [Web Platform Guide](/get_started/web_notes) for more details.

### Linux Setup

Linux distributions require the ALSA library for audio support. If missing, install it using your package manager:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S alsa-lib

# OpenSUSE
sudo zypper install alsa-devel
```

### iOS Configuration

When creating a release archive (IPA), you may need to modify symbol stripping to prevent errors:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Navigate to Target Runner > Build Settings > Strip Style
3. Change from "All Symbols" to "Non-Global Symbols"

## Basic Usage

Initialize SoLoud in your app:

```dart
void main() async {
  await SoLoud.instance.init(
    sampleRate: 44100,      // Audio quality
    bufferSize: 2048,       // Buffer size affects latency
    channels: Channels.stereo,
  );
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## Best Practices

- Initialize SoLoud early in your app lifecycle
- Handle initialization errors appropriately
- Configure buffer size based on your latency needs
- Clean up resources when your app closes
- Consider platform-specific requirements
