title: Without Opus/Vorbis
description: Configure builds without Opus and Vorbis libraries to reduce binary size
---

## Overview

The *Opus* and *Vorbis* libraries are embedded by default in flutter_soloud. However, if you don't need streaming capabilities, you can exclude these libraries to reduce your app's binary size by 600~1500 KB (depending on platform).

## Configuration Methods

### Linux, Windows, Android

#### VS Code Configuration
Add to `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Flutter debug", // and/or other build configurations
  "type": "dart",
  "request": "launch",
  "program": "lib/main.dart",
  "env": {
    "NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS": "1"
  }
}
```

#### Android Studio Setup
Add under Run/Debug Configurations:
```
Environment Variables: NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="1"
```

#### Gradle Build
It is also possible to configure the environment variables in the `android/gradle.properties`:
```
NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS=true # add this line
```

or int the `android/build.gradle.kts` add this snippet:
```
allprojects { extra["NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS"] = "true" }
```

#### Command Line Build
```bash
# Build without Opus/Ogg
flutter clean
flutter pub get
export NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="1" && flutter run

# Reset to default (with Opus/Ogg)
flutter clean
flutter pub get
export NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS= && flutter run  # Unsets the environment variable
```

## iOS/MacOS Setup
Add to `ios/Podfile` or `macos/Podfile`:
```ruby
ENV['NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS'] = '1'
```

<Warning>IDE environment variables are ignored for iOS and MacOS builds.</Warning>

### Web Platform

1. Edit `web/compile_wasm.sh`
2. Change `NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="0"` to `NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="1"`
3. Rebuild WASM files (ie run `web/compile_wasm.sh`)

Requirements:
- Emscripten installed
- Linux or MacOS for compilation
- Windows users need WSL

<Warning>IDE environment variables are ignored for web builds.</Warning>

## Impact on Functionality

When built without Opus/Vorbis:
- `setBufferStream()` and `readSamplesFrom*()` using Opus/Vorbis formats will throw exceptions
- Other audio formats remain fully functional
- Binary size reduces by 600~1500 KB
- All other features work normally
