title: Without Opus/Ogg
description: Configure builds without Opus and Ogg libraries to reduce binary size
---

## Overview

The Opus and Ogg libraries are embedded by default in flutter_soloud. However, if you don't need streaming capabilities, you can exclude these libraries to reduce your app's binary size by 600~1500 KB.

## Configuration Methods

### Linux, Windows, Android

#### VS Code Configuration
Add to `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Flutter debug", // and/or other configurations
  "type": "dart",
  "request": "launch",
  "program": "lib/main.dart",
  "env": {
    "NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS": "1"
  }
}
```

#### Android Studio Setup
Add under Run/Debug Configurations:
```
Environment Variables: NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="1"
```

#### Command Line Build
```bash
# Build without Opus/Ogg
flutter clean
flutter pub get
NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="1" flutter run

# Reset to default (with Opus/Ogg)
flutter clean
flutter pub get
NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS= flutter run  # Unsets the environment variable
```

## iOS/MacOS Setup
Add to `ios/Podfile` or `macos/Podfile`:
```ruby
ENV['NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS'] = '1'
```

<Warning>IDE environment variables are ignored for iOS and MacOS builds.</Warning>

### Web Platform

1. Edit `web/compile_wasm.sh`
2. Change `NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="0"` to `NO_OPUS_OGG_LIBS="1"`
3. Rebuild WASM files (ie run `web/compile_wasm.sh`)

Requirements:
- Emscripten installed
- Linux or MacOS for compilation
- Windows users need WSL

<Warning>IDE environment variables are ignored for web builds.</Warning>

## Impact on Functionality

When built without Opus/Ogg:
- `setBufferStream()` with Opus format will throw exceptions
- Other audio formats remain fully functional
- Binary size reduces by 600~1500 KB
- All other features work normally
