## Overview

*flutter_soloud* supports streaming audio data while receiving it in real-time. The supported audio data formats are raw PCM, MP3, or compressed through the [Opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/), [Vorbis](https://xiph.org/vorbis/), and [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/) codecs with [Ogg](https://xiph.org/ogg/) container libraries from [Xiph.org](https://www.xiph.org/). This is particularly useful when:
- Streaming audio from network sources like icecast radio
- Working with OpenAI or other streaming APIs
- Generating audio data on-the-fly
- Processing audio in chunks
- Automatically pause when buffering is needed and resume playback when enough data is available

The *Opus* and *Ogg* libraries are embedded by default in flutter_soloud. However, if you don't need streaming capabilities, please read the [Without Opus/Ogg](/get_started/no_opus_ogg_libs) section for how to exclude these libraries from your app.

## Buffer Stream Setup

Initialize an audio stream:

```dart
final stream = SoLoud.instance.setBufferStream(
  maxBufferSizeBytes: 1024 * 1024 * 10,   // 10MB of max buffer (not allocated)
  bufferingType: BufferingType.preserved, // Keep all data in memory
  bufferingTimeNeeds: 2.0,                // 2 seconds to buffer before unpausing
  sampleRate: 44100,                      // 44100 Hz
  channels: Channels.stereo,              // 2 channels
  format: BufferType.auto,                // Autodetect format (not valid for raw PCM)
  onBuffering: (isBuffering, handle, time) {
    // Handle buffering
  },
  onMetadata: (metadata) {
    // Handle metadata
  },
);
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `maxBufferSizeBytes`   | Maximum buffer size in **bytes**. When this limit is reached while adding audio data, the stream is considered ended (as if `setDataIsEnded` was called). Playback will stop at this point unless looping is enabled. Internally, all data is stored as floats, regardless of input format. This does **not** allocate memory upfront; it only limits the total data that can be added. |
| `maxBufferSizeDuration`| Alternative to `maxBufferSizeBytes`, specifies the maximum buffer size as a duration (in seconds), calculated using `sampleRate` and `channels`. No memory is allocated upfront. |
| `bufferingType`        | Determines how buffering works during playback. See below.<br/>  `BufferingType.preserved`: Keeps all audio data in memory, allows multiple playback instances, supports seeking and looping. <br/>`BufferingType.released`: Frees memory of already played data, allows only a single playback instance, and must be manually disposed. |
| `bufferingTimeNeeds`   | Buffering time required (in seconds). If playback reaches the end of the current buffer, it will pause and wait until enough data is buffered to cover this time. <br/> **Note:** With `BufferingType.released`, the stream position is always 0; use `getStreamTimeConsumed` to get elapsed time. |
| `sampleRate`           | Sample rate for playback (e.g., 22050 or 44100 Hz). For `opus` format, valid values are 48000, 24000, 16000, 12000, or 8000 Hz. Incoming data is resampled to this rate. |
| `channels`             | Number of audio channels. The `opus` format supports only mono and stereo. |
| `format`               | Audio data format. Options: `f32le`, `s8`, `s16le`, `s32le`, or`auto`. <br/>**Note:** the `auto` autodetect MP3 and Ogg container with Opus or Vorbis. With this format, the `samplerate` and `channels` parameters are ignored.|
| `onBuffering`          | Callback triggered when buffering starts (`isBuffering = true`) and ends (`isBuffering = false`). Receives the playback handle and the current buffered time (in seconds). |
| `onMetadata`          | Callback triggered when starting to add audio data or when metadata changes while streaming. It returns a `AudioMetadata` object. |

### Buffering Types

#### Preserved Mode
```dart
final stream = await SoLoud.instance.setBufferStream(
  bufferingType: BufferingType.preserved,
  // ...other parameters
);
```
![preserved](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8699bfd-2a40-4832-a7a8-d729d844c48b)
- Keeps all audio data in memory
- Allows multiple playback instances
- Supports seeking and looping
- Higher memory usage

#### Released Mode
```dart
final stream = await SoLoud.instance.setBufferStream(
  bufferingType: BufferingType.released,
  // ...other parameters
);
```
![released](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eb57688-ab0f-4859-813f-d23fff6ca10f)
- Frees played audio data
- The position of the stream is always 0
- The seek method is not supported
- Single playback instance only
- Lower memory usage
- Must be manually disposed

**WARNING**: as you can see, the position of the stream in `released` mode is always at start. This means that `getPosition` always returns 0. To get the already played time, you should use the `getStreamTimeConsumed` method instead (basically it is the current position). Also, `seek` is not supported in `released` mode.

Please, look at the `example/lib/buffer_stream/simple_noise_stream.dart` example for a simple implementation to understand how audio stream works.

### Supported Formats

For raw PCM data, the following formats are supported:
- `s8` - Signed 8-bit PCM
- `s16le` - Signed 16-bit PCM (little endian)
- `s32le` - Signed 32-bit PCM (little endian)
- `f32le` - 32-bit float PCM (little endian)

You should also need to specify the sample rate and the number of channels.
- `auto` - Automatically detect the format

Autodetected formats are:
- `mp3` - Mp3 format
- `opus` - Ogg container with Opus codec
- `ogg` - Ogg container with Vorbis codec
- `flac` - Ogg container with FLAC codec
These compressed formats are supporting metadata (using the `onMetadata` callback).


## Adding Audio Data

```dart
// Add audio data to the stream
SoLoud.instance.addAudioDataStream(
  stream,
  audioChunk,  // Uint8List of audio data
);

// Mark the stream as complete
SoLoud.instance.setDataIsEnded(stream);
```

## Buffer Management

```dart
// Get current buffer size in bytes
final size = SoLoud.instance.getBufferSize(stream);

// Reset the buffer
SoLoud.instance.resetBufferStream(stream);
```

## Example: Network Streaming

```dart
// Create a WebSocket connection
final socket =
    await WebSocket.connect('wss://audio-stream.example.com');

// Set up the audio stream
final stream = SoLoud.instance.setBufferStream(
  bufferingType: BufferingType.released,
  format: BufferType.opus,
  onBuffering: (isBuffering, handle, time) {
    // When isBuffering==true, the stream is set to paused automatically till
    // it reaches bufferingTimeNeeds of audio data or until setDataIsEnded is called
    // or maxBufferSizeBytes is reached. When isBuffering==false, the playback stream
    // is resumed.
    print('Buffering: $isBuffering, Time: $time');
  },
  onMetadata: (metadata) {
    debugPrint(metadata.toString());
  },
  }
);

// Start the the playback whenever enough data is buffered (defined by `bufferingTimeNeeds` seconds) whenever enough data is buffered (defined by `bufferingTimeNeeds` seconds)
final handle = await SoLoud.instance.play(stream);

// Eventually listen for the handle to finish playing.
// `SoLoud.setDataIsEnded` must be called before this listener
// could be emitted.
stream.soundEvents.listen((event) {
  if (event.event == SoundEventType.handleIsNoMoreValid &&
      event.handle == handle) {
    print('sound has finished playing');
  }
});

// Listen for audio data
socket.listen(
  (data) {
    if (data is List<int>) {
      SoLoud.instance.addAudioDataStream(
        stream,
        Uint8List.fromList(data),
      );
    }
  },
  onDone: () {
    // Mark the stream as completed.
    // You can then listen to the `stream.soundEvents` events
    SoLoud.instance.setDataIsEnded(stream);
  },
);
```

Please, look at the `example/lib/buffer_stream/web_radio.dart` example for a simple implementation to connect to an online icecast web radio or at `example/lib/buffer_stream/websocket.dart` example to connect to a WebSocket server (please read the note at the beginning).

## Example: PCM Generation

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<AudioSource> generatePCM() async {
  final pcmStream = SoLoud.instance.setBufferStream(
    maxBufferSizeBytes: 1024 * 1024,
    format: BufferType.s16le,
    channels: Channels.mono,
    sampleRate: 44100,
  );
  
  // Generate some PCM data
  final buffer = Int16List(44100);
  for (var i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
    buffer[i] = (sin(2 * pi * 440 * i / 44100) * 32767).toInt();
  }
  
  // Add to stream
  SoLoud.instance.addAudioDataStream(
    pcmStream,
    buffer.buffer.asUint8List(),
  );
  
  SoLoud.instance.setDataIsEnded(pcmStream);
  return pcmStream;
}
```



## Best Practices

- Use `BufferingType.released` for long streams
- Consider memory usage when streaming large files
- Handle network errors and buffering states
- Clean up streams when no longer needed
