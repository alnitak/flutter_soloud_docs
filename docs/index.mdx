## What is flutter_soloud?

A high-performance audio plugin designed primarily for games and immersive applications. 
If you merely need to play audio (such as playing a single sound effect or a non-looped song), and you don't need to worry about latency, there are other Flutter plugins you can use, such as the popular [`audioplayers` plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers).

Built on the SoLoud audio engine, it provides low latency, high-quality audio playback with advanced features.

<Card title="from the underlying engine's homepage" href="https://solhsa.com/soloud/index.html">
*SoLoud is an easy to use, free, portable c/c++ audio engine for games.*

*The engine has been designed to make simple things easy, while not making harder things impossible.*
</Card>

The `flutter_soloud` plugin uses the [SoLoud (C++) audio engine](https://solhsa.com/soloud/) with the [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) backend through [Dart's C interop](https://dart.dev/interop/c-interop) (`dart:ffi`).
In other words, it is calling the C/C++ methods of the underlying audio engine directly — there are no method channels in use.
